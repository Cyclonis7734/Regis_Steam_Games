## Steam Games data Cleanup, ROUND 2

## Clean up items:

### Franchise Cleanup
* Create 2 columns that respond to the Franchise column. 1 column as Y/N is a Franchise, and another for the count of games in the same Franchise.
  1. Added 2 columns to copy of current cleanup file.
  2. Used formulas for each column:
    * Y/N is a Franchise. Formula used If check, looking for blank cell in Franchise column. If blank, N, else Y.
    * Used COUNTIF function nested inside an If check in cell. If blank, show empty, else, count number of times name of Franchise appears.

## Developer/Publisher Cleanup
* Wanted to cleanup the dev/pub columns, to make sure there weren't myriad versions of the same names, but with subtle differences that are not warranted. Like, missing spaces in names or something like that. Discovered the following:
    1. Lots of developers and publishers have different breakouts, when they are larger. Often times this is based on country or specialization of some sort. For example, 2K games has multiple developer locations, like 2K Czech, 2K Australia, and 2K China, etc. For Publishers, they appear to have 3rd party companies in tandem, which are specific to the OS that the game was, probably, developed on. Repeatedly, you can find "2K, Aspyr (Linux)" or "2K, Aspyr (Mac)," as an example. My guess is that the Publisher column can have multiple companies involved.
    2. There are 9,308 unique entries for Developer. In 1 entry, I was able to find 11 unique Developers listed.
    3. There are 6,968 unique entries for Publisher. In 1 entry, I was able to find 5 unique Publishers.
  1. After discovering these points, I decided it was best to create a column for each one, where the count of unique Developers and Publishers was noted. To accomplish this, I would use a custom VBA function in Excel, to loop through the string given, and count the number of times a comma appears in the text.
  2. Occasionally, there would be Incorporated or LLC tags after a comma. I found as many of these as I could, and removed them by find and replace from a copy of the dataset that would be the final version post these Dev/Pub cleanup steps. Variations found and removed/fixed are:
        * , ltd. --> ""
        * , ltd  --> ""
        * , llc  --> ""
        * , llc. --> ""
        * , co.  --> ""
        * , inc. --> ""
  3. Post removal of these company type indication texts, the counts for many devs/pubs was more accurate, when calculated by the custom VBA function.
  4. Assuming that the 1st developer/publisher listed is the "favored" developer/publisher, I also opted to include this particular point in a column as well. This column will be called the Primary Dev/Pub, and will show ONLY the first dev/pub, up until a comma is found, OR will just show the value in the dev/pub, if no comma is found. To accomplish this, I used an if check, looking at the count of developers column we made. if count is less than or equal to 1, then show the dev/pub, else, show everything up until the first comma.

### Genre Cleanup
* Goal is to handle this, similarly, to how I handled the ESRBWhy section, and try to create additional columns for each possible Genre. Provided there are not hundreds, like there were for ESRBWhy. I believe Genres are different from Tags on Steam's website/database, because tags are given by players/users, whereas Genres are selected by the developer/publisher. Genres are more "hardcoded" than tags are, for whatever reason. This was one reason why I decided to use Genres over Tags, since it's a single selection, and does not rely on user data to be incoming. The expectation coming up for this, is that we attempt to predict what the reviews will be, or what the cost of the game will be. If we have Tag data, then the game is already out, defeating the purpose of predictions. Unless of course, the idea is to provide some sort of defense against why a game does poorly (by all rights the game should have done well, because the prediction model said so!).
  1. Remove dups from Genre list, breakout into singular entries by splitting at commas.
  2. After cleaning up some of the Genre tags (removing excess spaces, alphabetizing, etc), I found a few "genres" that were NOT actually Genres. Most of the items that fit this criteria were probably pull errors during webscraping, where a field was pulled which was not the actual Genre, but rather something else entirely. These items were subsequently removed. Post removal, I had 20 Genres available. Before implementing all 20, I wanted to get a count of each. After obtaining counts, I wound up dropping thos that had single digit counts. Those consisted of Animation & Modeling, Audio Production, Design & Illustration, Education, Game Development, Utilities, and Video Production.
  3. Post researching the genres to keep, I added all 12 new columns, and implemented an if check that searches for each genre within the list given, marking Y/N when appropriate. During adding these, I though it might be of interest, to see if any of the ESRBWhy verbiage was the same as a Genre tag. There were no exact matches, and all of these words could be useful in determining the review/cost of a game.

### Price Cleanup
  * Goal is to remove data which may have "Bad" data for this, or to reassign Free to play games to be 0.
    1. Remove dups from list, sort values, and flag non-numeric.
    2. Create a column that can be used for lookup, to interpret what the price column should be, if not a number already.
    3. Apply new values to Price column, using a VLOOKUP formula.
    4. The decision of dropping and/or deleting titles based on the price column, wound up removing a total of 58 columns.

### Final Thoughts for 7/18/2020

After doing the cleanup steps for this week, based off of my previous Final thoughts for the last Cleanup work done, I realized a few things. The last two items are probably best left alone, until we have completed EDA.

Review ratings are pretty straightforward, and both are on the same scale even. The real question will be, how to approach these values during prediction. I'd say it warrants separate breakouts of the data, as it stands now, simply because there are so many entries that do NOT have a Metacritic score or Steam Review data yet.

As for date range buckets as a possibility. This is a nice thought, but one that would require an additional pull of the data, at a different date. We simply don't have the time to do that, nor do I wish to repeat these cleanup steps again at a later date, on a different data set. This idea would be fantastic, if we had a reliable method for obtaining a list of games from steam, that was completely repeatable, and wielded clean-ish data, every time it was run.

## Steam Games Exploratory Data Analysis

## Things to do:

### Get Data into Jupyter Notebook
* Required additional parameter setting in the pandas read_csv function. Apparently the csv encoding (when saving from Excel I guess?) was set for something other than what pandas' default mode was. Used encoding parameter to set value to "ISO-8859-1," and the csv file was pulled in without issue.
* Did due dilligence on data, and reviewed from a high level.
* After reviewing, removed columns of data that were unnecessary to keep for any and all EDA and Modeling.

### EDA
* Performed multiple iterations of EDA on data set. Focused on:
  * Asked a bunch of questions to the data. Answered, usually, within one or two lines of code.
  * Deep dove into various topics.

Clean up time for the games list
Clean up items:
  -Remove excess entries from game_ID list. Get rid of lists, keeping only the first game id. The VBA code followed this procedure when continuing the scraping.
  -Remove duplicate entries from the list. After getting rid of the excessive entries in the Game_ID column, there will probably be duplicate entries.
  -Discern release date, based off of whether or not Release1 or Release2 has a valid date. Determine a method to settle disagreements between the values in each, if they occur.
  -Perform melting on ESRBWhy column's values. separate out the values within, to have their own columns for each possible type.
